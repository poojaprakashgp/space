Let me rephrase my question for better clarity:
When a user tries to purchase a product at full price and enters their mobile number for verification, do we need to display a field for them to manually enter the OTP?
Or is the OTP validation expected to fail automatically if they are not eligible due to any ongoing offer conditions?
Please let me know if this makes sense or if youâ€™d like me to explain further.
