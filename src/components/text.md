Here’s an update on the pending translation tasks for the Checkout flow:
 
The SSN field with the “Show” button is coming from VDS.
 
The CVV info tooltip is also from VDS.
 
Under the Finance section, the DOB form labels and details are currently hardcoded.
 
The error messages are coming from the API, which need to be translated.
 
The Login and Create Account modals are handled by the Frorzrock team.
 
Please let me know if any of these require clarification or if we should prioritize any specific item.
